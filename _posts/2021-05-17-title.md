# One small step for Keiana, one giant leap for... well, Keiana.

I'd like to welcome myself to Github, a platform that I orginially thought had no space for someone like me. A young black woman in content marketing, who also loves food and nail art. Who'd be look for me here?? Well, I'm still unsure of that answer... but here I am!

This will be a journey of creativity and connection, centered in the backgrounds of branding, copywriting, and technology. Anything is up for discussion, or question. 

Let the free thought commence!
